## Word Count Generator

This program takes a large string of text as input and generates a word count. It counts the occurrences of each word in the string and returns a map containing each word's count. The program assumes that the string only contains alphabetic characters and spaces.

### Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Provide a large string of text as input.
2. Execute the program.
3. The program will count the occurrences of each word in the input string.
4. The program will return a map containing each word and its count.

## Removing Duplicates

This program takes an array of numbers as input and removes all the duplicates, returning a new set that contains only the unique elements.

### Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Prepare an array of numbers.
2. Execute the program.
3. The program will remove all the duplicate numbers from the array.
4. The program will return a new set containing only the unique elements.

## Swapping Values

This program swaps the values of two variables without using a temporary variable. It uses destructuring assignment with an array to swap the positions of the variables within the array. The program returns an array with the swapped values.

### Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Define two variables with values that need to be swapped.
2. Execute the program, passing the two variables as arguments.
3. The program will swap the values of the variables using destructuring assignment.
4. The program will return an array with the swapped values.

## Extracting Elements

This program takes an array of numbers as input and extracts the first, second, and last elements using destructuring assignment with an array. It returns an array with these three values.

### Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Prepare an array of numbers.
2. Execute the program, passing the array as an argument.
3. The program will extract the first, second, and last elements from the array using destructuring assignment.
4. The program will return an array containing the extracted elements.

## Finding Min and Max Values

This program finds the maximum and minimum values in an array of numbers using the spread operator with the `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` methods. It returns an object with two properties, `max` and `min`, representing the maximum and minimum values in the input array, respectively.

### Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Prepare an array of numbers.
2. Execute the program, passing the array as an argument.
3. The program will find the maximum and minimum values in the array using the spread operator with `Math.max()` and `Math.min()`.
4. The program will return an object with the `max` and `min` properties representing the maximum and minimum values.
